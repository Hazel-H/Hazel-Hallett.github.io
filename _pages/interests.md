**Sport**
*	I started rowing at Bath University as a novice, balancing intense training (over 16 hours a week) alongside my studies.  I have since competed in multiple national regattas, representing Bath in the first ‘four’ boat and achieved 3rd place at the 2018 BUCS regatta. Most recently, I raced the. 2021 Henley Women's Regatta in the first eight, making it through to the quarter finals. 
* Currently in training for a half Ironman distance triathlon, fundraising for Macmillan. 
* Competed in National Sailing Championships and racing crew for the 2015 Tall Ships race, sailing to Norway.
