Master's Project Sep 2021 - Jan 2022: Climate Change and Arctic Soundscapes
* Analysing underwater acoustics data in MATLAB/R to quantitatively measure climate change through ice processes in Arctic locations. PAMGuide software will be used to process and calibrate the acoustic data creating metrics such as Sound Pressure Levels and Spectral Probability Densities for analysis. The aim is to identify acoustic signatures relating to ice formation/melting ice processes. 
* The project is supervised by Dr Philippe Blondel. Dr Blondel chairs the international working group Arctic Acoustic Environments, responsible for achieving International Quiet Ocean Experiment (IQOE) goals in relation to the Arctic environments, demonstrating his prominence in the global research field. The environmental change in the Arctic is of global concern and responsibility. Over the past 30 years there has been a 30% reduction in ice extent and reduction in the average ice thickness from 4m to 1.5m. As a consequence, research into climate change is crucial, with governments around the world working together to meet climate targets through initiatives like Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Climate change is most visible in the Arctic due to melting ice and PAM researching methods have large logistical and economic benefits, highlighting the importance of this research.
